# Dryads
*Dryads* is the name of tree nymphs in Greek mythology and a toolkit that includes convenient functions to explore the dendrogram (the *"tree diagram"*) and to derive properties based on the dendrogram structures.

`Dryads` uses [the `astrodendro` package](http://dendrograms.org) to calculate the dendrogram.

## Status of the Package
Currently, `Dryads` is under active development and does not support a full installation through services like `pip`.  You are welcome to try the codes by downloading the github repo, only at your own risk.  You are also welcome to report issues/suggest features via [the issue tracker](https://github.com/hopehhchen/Dryads/issues).


## Tutorial
`dev.ipynb` is used for code development, but serves as a good overview and a simple tutorial for `Dryads`.  A more complete tutorial with documentation will be added.

### Acknowledgement
[Hope Chen](https://github.com/hopehhchen) is currently in charge of the development and maintainence of `Drayads`.  The project was started by Stella Offner and Chris Faesi as a way to analyse the pressure profiles within star forming clumps/cores.

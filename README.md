# Dryads
*Dryads* is the name of tree nymphs in Greek mythology and a toolkit that includes convenient functions to explore the dendrogram (the *"tree diagram"*) and to derive properties based on the dendrogram structures.

`Dryads` uses [the `astrodendro` package](http://dendrograms.org) to calculate the dendrogram.


## Tutorial
`dev.ipynb` is used for code development, but serves as a good overview and a simple tutorial for `Dryads`.  A more complete tutorial with documentation will be added.
